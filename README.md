🗺️ Interactive Notes App with Map Integration

Interactive Notes App is a modern web-based application that allows users to create, view, and manage notes directly on an interactive map. Each note can be pinned to a specific longitude and latitude, providing a spatial context for your ideas, reminders, or location-based information.

This project is built with the concept of a Single Page Application (SPA), ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience without full-page reloads. Smooth page transitions are implemented to enhance interactivity and visual appeal, making navigation intuitive and engaging.
